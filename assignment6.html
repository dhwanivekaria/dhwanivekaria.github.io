            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
          For this project I wanted to make coaster but I wanted them to be a unique shape... so I opted for leaf shape. I found this stl file on thingsverse. So after looking at the file. I started looking into the design I decided to 3D print my outer first mold. In order to do that I started the rihno file and watching the tutorial of Nadia's on how to build the outer box case.

            I started by working on the rhino file and making boxes
            <p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="A6/Rhino1.png" style="width:80%">
            </div>
          </div>

            <p>
          Then I extruded the parts. I started out line the boxes and extruded and caped the outer box to be 2.5in and inner box to be 2.2 in.

            <h2>Printing Process</h2>
            <p>
			After finishing design in Rhino, I exported the Stl files to Dremel. After that, I tried to resize my leaf. When resizing I ran into issues about how much height I wanted for my leaf and estimately I reduced the side of it. Through resizing I made it to be about .8 in of thickness thinking it would be enough got the mold.
            <p>
              <p>
                When using Dremel I converted all the in to mm. I didn't realize it was checked uniform settings. So it messed up my leaf. I realized that after the mold was printed. So, appraently it turned out to be a leaf stamp instead of coasters.

            After the getting into the print. Below is the outer mold:

            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Omoo Mold</h2>
            <p>
			I started on with taking an estimate of Part A and Part B into a cup and mixed it rigorusly until proper mixed and it was a purple color so.. I guessed that it will cure well now. I poured it into the mold. And left it overnight to cure. It surprisingly turned out fine..

            <h2>Plaster and Creating the stamps</h2>
            <p>
		After setting the mold, I started with the borrowed plaster from Lucas from the mill. Even though it was easy but I had not worked with plaster before so I had no idea where to start with. So, from what I heard in class I mixed parts equally but it turned out to be thin and I started getting crack in the leaf.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
           <img src="A6/break1.png" width=500></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I tried to do less water in the second one but still it cracked and kept cracking.
            </p>

              <img src="A6/break3.png" width=500></a>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              So, eventually I used lesser water than before and it worked out finally! phew!
