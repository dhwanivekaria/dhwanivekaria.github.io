            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
            My design idea was inspired by the globe. I wanted to make something simple yet effective and then I looked into moving globes. Therefore, I decided to design a simpler version of the globe being a gyroscope.

            </p>
            After sketching some basic ideas and getting help from thingsverse.com , I first started my design in Rhino and then moved it by converting it to stp in Onshape. I was having a difficult time learning Onshape and I was limited because of some of the features. After, importing my stp files in Onshape I changed bit of a dimension of each of the ring and adjusted it a bit. I kept the size of my rings to be about 0.8inches so its not too thick nor too thin to fall of when press fitted together.

            After extruding, I tried to assemble the body, but couldn't not find a way to assemble the rings as there was no base to it.

            <h2>Printing Process</h2>
            <p>
			After finishing design in Onshape, I exported the surface of all the parts into stl files. First, I tried to print all the rings into one print bed but certainly due to extruders not working properly it took a while to start the print. Then, leaving that I divided my rings into 2 parts one printer would print 3 and other would print the outer most ring. While I started that I noticed that the first layer with the cones had difficult to print and rather than one shape it printed tiny cones differently. So, I learned from Lucas that you had to put the quality high when selcting to prepare to print in Dremel. Using that tip, I started to print my Rings in the printer and I set the nozzel temp. at 235 and bed temp. at 60 so I could make it go faster. It took about 2 hr 50 min to print all the parts.

            Here are all the parts I used for building the gyroscope

			As the  rings are the moving parts, it can pretty much go in any direction.
