              <h3>Inspiration</h3>
              <p>
                Me and my roommate have a cat and I wanted to build a toy of some kind for her. She loves to play with teasers but thought it might get boring to just build one. So through some reearch I learned about the baby mobiles and thought why not something along the lines for a cat.

              My final project concept is a hand held or attachable cat toy mobile made with the combination of several techniques: 2D Design, Laser Cutting, Moving Parts, and 3D CAD design and printing. The intended use case is for playing and making cats excersice. The context can be hand-held, and can also be stuck into under the table as thats our fav place of our cat.
